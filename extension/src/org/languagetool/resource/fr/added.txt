# A part-of-speech dictionary that's used additionally to the binary dictionary (*.dict).
# This does not add words to the spell checker, see hunspell/spelling.txt for that.
# File Encoding: UTF-8
# Format: three semicolon-separated fields: fullform;baseform;postags
# IMPORTANT: always use only straight (typewriter) apostrophes, not typographical apostrophes
# Apostrophes in words trigger specific tokenization: common forms (e.g., L'Obs) are multitoken, while non regular usage (e.g., Crit'Air) remain unsplit.
